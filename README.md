# 2D-Interactive-Horror-Game
Developed a 2D game application with a team of 3 colleagues in Java. Implemented player, monster, health points, inventories, items, maps, collision detections, and keyboard inputs to create a full immersion of the game. The 2D role playing game allows users to interact with the maps, inventories, and sprites using the keyboard inputs. Inventories allows items to be stored and used based on certain interactions. Health points measures the health of the main character that allows users to continue with the game. Utilized software testing methodologies to ensure game completion with optimized outputs through these phases: defining game requirements, created systems design document, implementation, quality assurance testing, and deployment/maintenance.   

The objective of this game is to interact with maps that revolves around living room and bedroom utilizing items in order to escape the house. Users must avoid hits from the monster spawned around the house to continue with the game. When the player successfully escapes, the game is completed.
